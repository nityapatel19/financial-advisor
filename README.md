# Abstract 

There is a dire lack of financial knowledge in our society. This lack of knowledge, coupled with the insecurity which people harbour within themselves of their future, often leads them to take some grave steps that risk their lives’ financial stability.
With this, the need for financial literacy or a personal finance manager is pressing. Inculcating financial literacy among the masses is a near-impossible feat to achieve in a short span of time. Therefore, this leaves us with the only option of having a personal finance manager, which would advise and manage all your financial issues.
The only issue with this being that they are expensive. And for someone of humble origins, advising this would be a Catch-22. Therefore, a cheap, and ideally a cost-free financial adviser is the need of the hour.

The aim of our application: “Personal Finance Advisor” is to address this very issue which plagues people. It is a cost-effective solution providing various features like investment risk management, retirement plan etc...

In conclusion, this application would effectively manage an average joes’ finances, ultimately helping them in need.


Final project is in the folder "finance", apologies for bad file management.
